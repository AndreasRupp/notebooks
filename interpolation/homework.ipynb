    "Lagrange's interpolation is a purely algebraic result, and it also holds in fields other than the field of real numbers. [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing) (SSS) is a scheme in cryptography based on Lagrange's interpolation in a finite field. We will consider a naive version of the scheme using integer arithmetic as in the [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing#Example) in Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSS is used to secure a secret in a distributed way, most often to secure other encryption keys. The secret is split into $n$ parts, called shares. These shares are used to reconstruct the original secret. To unlock the secret via SSS, a minimum number $k$ of the $n$ shares are needed. An adversary who discovers any number of shares less than $k$ will not have any information about the secured secret, this is called perfect secrecy.\n",
    "\n",
    "SSS works by choosing a polynomial of degree $k-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\dots a_{k-1} x^{k-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where an integer $a_0$ is the secret to be secured, and $a_1,\\dots,a_{k-1}$ are randomly chosen integers. The $n$ shares are given by the pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(i, f(i)), \\qquad i=1,\\dots,n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any $k$ distinct shares $(x_j, f(x_j))$, $j=1,\\dots,k$, the secret can be recovered by forming the Lagrange interpolation polynomial $p \\in \\mathbb P_{k-1}$ through these points, and by evaluating $p(0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement this recovery algorithm as the function `recover_secret`. This function must return an integer, not a float. You can use [round](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round) to convert a float to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(When the integer arithmetic is used, an adversary with access to less than $k$ shares has information on the secret since the possible values of the other shares must lie on a smooth polynomial curve of degree $k-1$. This weakness is eliminated by using the arithmetic in a finite field.)"
