    "Monte Carlo integration is a technique for numerical integration using random numbers. It can be useful, for example, when evaluating integrals over domains of high dimension. Meshing in high dimensions suffers from the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality): 100 evenly spaced sample points suffice to sample the unit interval $[0,1]$ with no more than 0.01 distance between points, whereas sampling of the 10-dimensional unit hypercube $[0,1]^{10}$ with a lattice that has a spacing of 0.01 between adjacent points would require $10^{20}$ sample points.\n",
