    "The global behavior of Newton's method when solving for complex roots of polynomials is a classical problem. The expository article\n",

    "As a historical note, in 1984, displays (or raster graphic devices as they are called in the article) capable of producing colorful 500 by 500 images were not a commodity. The [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer), released in 1981, was able to display 16 colors. The figures in the article were produced in the Computer Graphics Laboratory at the University of Utah, a leading research group at the time, see the [history of computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics#1970s). I would guess that Evans & Sutherland frame buffers were used, see the [history of framebuffers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framebuffer#History). David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland were professors at the University of Utah.\n",

    "The goal of this homework is to reproduce Figure 4A of the article, at least in low resolution. The figure shows the basin of attraction of $z=1$ when solving $z^3 = 1$ in the complex plane using Newton's method. The basin of attaction of $z=1$ is the set of points $z_0$ for which the method converges to $1$ when started with the initial guess $z_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure is created as follows: for each point $z_0$ in the rectangle\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R = \\{x + i y \\in \\mathbb C \\mid x,y \\in [-1,1] \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "use Newton's method to solve $z^3 = 1$ with the initial guess $z_0$. If $|z - 1|<\\epsilon$ for the solution $z$ given by the method, draw $z_0$ in white. Otherwise, draw $z_0$ in black. Here $\\epsilon > 0$ is some small number, say $10^{-4}$ (and $z$ being $\\epsilon$-close to 1 is used as a proxy for convergence to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a slightly more gereral function `basin` defined as follows: given $z \\in R$, return the index of the basin of attraction to which $z$ belongs.\n",
    "The indexing should be as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0 for the root $1$\n",
    "* 1 for the root $e^{i 2/3 \\pi}$\n",
    "* 2 for the root $e^{-i 2/3 \\pi}$\n",
    "* 4 if the method didn't converge to any of the roots \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to `exp` in the example on 3d plotting in the Python introduction, your `basin` function should work when the input is an array generated by `meshgrid`. Function `newton_demo` in the lecture notes works with this type of input, but you will need to implement the test $|z - 1|< \\epsilon$ in a way that allows $z$ to be an array. Let's have a look at a couple of related examples. "
